Was commissioned to create a custom table tent to present the new QR code
menuâ€™s from both [Chop Bar](https://www.oaklandchopbar.com/) and
[Calavera](https://calaveraoakland.com/). Two of the hottest restaurants in
Oakland. I used [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/en/) to do the 3D modeling
and used both [Universal](https://www.ulsinc.com/) and
[Glowforge](https://glowforge.com/) laser cutters to cut and etch the wooden parts
for the base and the acrylic parts for the standing top.
